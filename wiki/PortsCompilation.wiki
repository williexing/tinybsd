=Using ports to compile in our image=

    This tutorial explains how to use  ports to install inside your image. We suppose you have a large image. We suppose too you are using a build server to make a better compilation performance.
    If you have things installed in your build system using ports, its better you clean all work directories.

#cd /usr/ports && make clean 

   Logged has root, mount the image:
  
#mdconfig -a -t vnode -u 0 -t tinybsd.bin

This will create a device md?[a]:

#ls /dev/md*

/dev/md? /dev/md? /dev/md? 

   Now mount:

#mount /dev/md? /media/

#ls /media/

.cshrc COPYRIGHT dev libexec proc sbin var .profile bin etc media rescue tmp .snap boot lib mnt root usr

   To install:

#cd /usr/ports/x11/xorg-minimal

#make clean

#make install clean PREFIX=/media/usr/local LOCALBASE=/media/usr/local FORCE_PKG_REGISTER=1 BATCH=1 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/media/lib
